The timestamp format is depending on requested timeOutputFormat. 'Normal' timestamp format is: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.mmmmmm] TZ, the microsecond part is optional if 0.

'Iso8601' timstamp format is: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmmz. z is the relative time zone offset in hours and minutes to UTC in the format +hhmm or -hhmm. If UTC is used z will be 'Z' instead of '+0000'. 'Source' timestamp format is number of microseconds since 1 Jan 1970 minus any leap seconds in UTC. 'Source' is in integer type, while the other are in string type. This property is not set until the first alarm is raised.",
