                     2f0d2bf8f DND-27601: NBC: Set dyn-MD for authority header handling
                     It makes the configuration of "keep authority header" explicit for the
                     route to pool/roaming-partner actions (both round-robin type). The
                     strict-routing type is not affected.

                     The SEPP/SCP manager must set the attribute "keep_authority_header" in
                     RouteToPoolAction and RouteToRoamingPartnerAction if this is configured
                     by the user.

                     Since this involves a protobuf change, you have to update the
                     eric_proxy.proto file in the Java code. You can get it from:

                    Bugfix DND-26376 Fix the response filter chain after action_reject
                           After an action-reject in phase 1 (inc. Msg.Screening) response screening
                           in phase 4 was applied, as envoy creates a complete filter chain for the
                           repsonse handling. The solution is to let the filter performing the rejection
                           add an indication that an internal reject was triggered and by whom as dynamic
                           metadata. On response, the eric-proxy filter will pass the response (without action)
                           if this metadata is present and the message was not rejected by the filter instance
                           itself. The filter instance, which had rejected the message will reset the metadata
                           and process the reponse as usual.

                         The filter is renamed to make it independent of SEPP and SCP.
                         The protobuf version is changed from v3alpha -> v3.
                         The Java class name for the generated protobuf accessors is changed from
                         SeppProto -> EricProxyProto.
                         The protobuf toplevel message SeppConfig -> message EricProxyConfig.
                    New: Change header x-lua to x-eric-proxy
                         The header x-lua (so far un-used) has been renamed to x-eric-proxy and
                         can be used in the manager to have the "catch-all-route" at the first
                         position instead of the last position in the Envoy routing-table.
                         The catch-all route is the one that matches when a request comes in,
                         before the request goes into the http-filter chain.
                         Moving the catch-all-route up has performance benefits.
                         The manager shall configure Envoy to remove the x-eric-proxy header
                         when the request leaves Envoy.
                    New: NBC Change StringValue to Value for isInSubnet
                         Change the type for the isInSubnet operator from StringValue to Value
                         which helps the implementation in the SCP/SEPP-Manager.
                    Protobuf: Change StringValue to Value for isInSubnet
                    New: NBC Add preserve-if-indirect and preferred_target to RouteToPoolAction
                         Replace the routing-behaviour TARGET_API_ROOT by the two new parameters
                         in RouteToPoolAction: preserve_if_indirect and preferred_target.

                         "preserve_if_indirect" specifies which data has to be preserved for
                         indirect routing (= next hop is an SCP) vs. direct routing (= next hop
                         is a NF). Currently, there is TARGET_API_ROOT which is equivalent to the
                         former RoutingBehaviour with the same name, and there is ABSOLUTE_PATH.
                         Indirect routing will use the absolute path (if there was one, if not it
                         will disable preservation of the absolute-path for this request because
                         there is no absolute path to use), and direct routing will use the
                         relative path.

                         "preferred_target" specifies that there is a preferred host, and from
                         where to read it (variable or header. String constant is also possible
                         but not that useful). The preferred host only the host, not the port,
                         schema, or URL-path.i
                         Unchanged: The preferred host is stored in the "host" dynamic metadata
                         for the subet-loadbalancer and in the "x-host" header for Envoy-routes
                         and omit-host-metadata configuration.

                         A new "isInSubnet" operator that can be used in predicate-expressions
                          to implement subnet-based routing. The "isInSubnet" operator can handle
                          both IPv4 and IPv6 automatically, and expands compact IPv6 addresses
                          before making the subnet-check. The IP-address can come from either:
                          - a header (req.header["address"] isInSubnet "10.0.0.0/24")
                          - a variable that was set in a message-data configuration
                            (var.address isInSubnet "fe80::f816:3eff:fed3:4887/64")
                          - a string constant, which is not really useful but implemented to
                            avoid creating too many data-types in the protobuf definition.
                          The addresses must be the pure addresses, that is:
                          - without a port (OK: 10.0.0.4, Not OK: 10.0.0.4:80,
                            OK: fe80::f816:3eff:fed3:4887, Not OK: [fe80::f816:3eff:fed3:4887]:80)
                          - without square brackets if it's an IPv6 address
                            (OK: fe80::f816:3eff:fed3:4887, Not OK: [fe80::f816:3eff:fed3:4887]
                          An IPv4 address is never in an IPv6 subnet, also not vice versa.
