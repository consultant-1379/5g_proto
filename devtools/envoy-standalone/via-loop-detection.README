Test loop-protection with via-headers. Envoy is configured to add a via-header with
its own ID. In the routing section, a match on the via-header is added that checks
for the Envoy-ID being present in the via-header. If yes, then Envoy directly replies
with 508.
The regex to find the Envoy-ID in the via-header contains the Envoy-ID twice because
Envoy adds the via-header before the request goes into the routing section.
