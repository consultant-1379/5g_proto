    FunctionalityUsedInTheEricssonProduct: A Java API for generating .java source files. Source file generation can be useful when doing things such as annotation processing or interacting with metadata files (e.g., database schemas, protocol formats). By generating code, you eliminate the need to write boilerplate while also keeping a single source of truth for the metadata.
