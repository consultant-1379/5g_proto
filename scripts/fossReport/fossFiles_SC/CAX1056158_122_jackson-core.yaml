    FunctionalityUsedInTheEricssonProduct: This library aims to enable Metrics-Driven Development for C++ services. It implements the Prometheus Data Model, a powerful abstraction on which to collect and expose metrics. We offer the possibility for metrics to be collected by Prometheus, but other push/pull collections can be added as plugins.
