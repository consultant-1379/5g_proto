    FunctionalityUsedInTheEricssonProduct: 'XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types. XMLBeans provides several ways to get at the XML, including: Through XML schema that has been compiled to generate Java types that represent schema types. In this way, you can access instances of the schema through JavaBeans-style accessors after the fashion of getFoo and setFoo. The XMLBeans API also allows you to reflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model; A cursor model through which you can traverse the full XML infoset; Support for XML DOM.'
