    FunctionalityUsedInTheEricssonProduct: Restlet is a very flexible framework that is suitable for most Web application developments. Thanks to its unique design, it can be used for both client-side and server-side applications and of course for applications that act as both clients and servers. With the availability of a port for the GWT platform, it can also work in your favourite Web browser!
