    FunctionalityUsedInTheEricssonProduct: "The JAXB API, defined in the javax.xml.bind package, is a set of interfaces through which client applications communicate with code generated from a schema. The center of the JAXB API is JAXBContext, the client's entry point. It provides an abstraction for managing the XML-Java binding information necessary to implement the JAXB binding framework operations: unmarshal, marshal and validate."
