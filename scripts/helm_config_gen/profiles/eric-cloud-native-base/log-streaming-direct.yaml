## Feature Description:
## 1) All container logs are NOT sent to stdout
## 2) All services send logs directly to Log Transformer via a logshipper sidecar, syslog client, TCP etc.
## 3) Log Shipper is deployed as a sidecar container only in the services that use a sidecar (not in those using syslog client etc.)

## Note: All SC services use logshipper sidecar.
