## Feature Description:
## 1) All container logs are sent to stdout
## 2) All services utilize the direct log streaming feature (via logshipper sidecar, syslog client etc.)
## 3) Log Shipper is deployed as a sidecar container (in the services that use sidecar)

## Note:
## 1) The services that do not use logshipper sidecar container send logs directly to Log Transformer via TCP, Syslog Client etc.
## 2) All SC services use logshipper sidecar.
## 3) global.logshipper.deployment.type can also be "" (empty), which deploys Log Shipper as Deamonset. In this case
##    we may have double logs in Search Engine since the logs are shipped both by the the sidecars and the Daemonset

global:
  log:
    streamingMethod: "dual" # logs in stdout + enables direct log streaming
  logShipper:
    deployment:
      type: "sidecar" # deploys Log Shipper as sidecar
